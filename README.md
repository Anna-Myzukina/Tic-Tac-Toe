# Tic-Tac-Toe
Ruby Programming PROJECT: OOP Project 1: Tic Tac Toe

## Assignment 1
* Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

* Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.

* Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.

* [Creating a Tic Tac Toe Game with Ruby](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/)

* [build a two-player CLI version of Tic Tac Toe by defining a set of methods to encapsulate the game logic.](https://learn.co/tracks/bootcamp-prep-v2/ruby-fundamentals/tic-tac-toe/tictactoe-rb)
