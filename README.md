# Tic-Tac-Toe
Ruby Programming PROJECT: OOP Project 1: Tic Tac Toe

## Assignment 1
* Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

* Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.

* Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.
